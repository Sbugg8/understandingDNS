<h1>Understading DNS</h1>
In this lab, we will explore and experiment with the Domain Name System (DNS) to gain a beter understanding of how it works. DNS convers computer names to IP addresses which can be used by the computer to locate resouces. DNS is integrated wuth Active Directory and automatically gets installed on the Domain Controller(DC).

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- DNS

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

- A Virtual Machine with Active Directory
- A Client VM joined to your Network 

<h2>DNS Steps</h2>

DNS (Domain Name System) is like the phonebook of the internet. It translates human-friendly website names (like google.com) into computer-friendly IP addresses (like 142.250.190.14).

The DC also doubles as a DNS server, which means its responsible for resolving all requests from the network. In order to do this, the server uses "Root Hint". A Root Hint Server is a special type of DNS server that helps other DNS servers find the root of the internet's domain name system (DNS). It acts as a starting point when a DNS server needs to resolve a domain name but doesnâ€™t have the answer cached or stored locally.
